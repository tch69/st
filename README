st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This is my personal build of st, including my keybinds and following patches:
- alpha
- anysize
- blinking cursor
- bold is not bright
- clipboard
- font2
- newterm
- nobadweight
- scrollback (ringbuffer + mouse)
- xresources

The default PREFIX is ${HOME}/.local. Doing
"sudo/doas/`su -c` make install" is never recommended.
